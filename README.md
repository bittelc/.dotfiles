Need to sketch out this README better.

1. To get zsh profile working correctly (dependent on hardcoded ".dotfiles" directory; install zsh; symlink .zshenv;)
2. To get iTerm preferences working correctly (iTerm preferences => load preferences from hardcoded `.dotfiles/` directory)
3. To get Vim preferences working correctly (symlink `.vimrc` to hardcoded `.dotfiles/.vimrc`)
